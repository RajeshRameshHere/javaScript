/* The method we used above to declare variable is a old feature and now the javascript is updaring we use "let" key word to declare a veriable
    once u declare a variable you cannot declare it again,but u can reassign  the value of it 
    declaring variable twice will give you error

    a string can also be declared inbetween single qoutes '' in javaScript

    if u want to use a double qoute "" in your string then use single qoute '' to declare it, if there is single qoute in ur string then go for double qoutes ""

    no need of escaping sequence in javascript
